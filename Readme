after "ab -c 100 -n 10000 localhost:8888/status" I took result in file ab.jpg

There are 9992 failed requests in it because first responses had the same length.
When first requests begun, count of completed connections is null.
Count of first requests was {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ...}.
My server do 8 channels concurrently.
9th response had statistic about completed connections, that's why length was other.

"/status" shows only completed connections. There is no information about itself.
That information will be in next "/status" request connection.
